projects, allowing you to focus on your peculiar business logic. This project supports the following features:
- User registration
- User login using the password grant type
- User token refresh using the refresh token
- User logout
- API method security with user roles and permissions

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Prerequisites  
To successfully use this module in your project, you'll need:
- **Java 17 as a minimum version.** That is because this project was developed using Spring Boot 3, which requires Java 17
as a minimum version.
- **Apache Maven**

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use this module in your project:
1. Fork the repository

2. Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-git-username>/spring-security-jwt.git
```

3. A docker compose file is attached to this project to help you easily set up a development database. To do this,
  run the following command in your terminal or command prompt
```
docker compose up -d
```
This command will spin-up the following containers running in a detached mode: 
- A postgres database running on `localhost:5431`, and 
- A pgAdmin UI running on `localhost:5050` for managing the database.

4. Using the `pgAdmin` interface or your `psql`, set up a database called starter. If you wish to name this database 
something different, do well to update the `application.yml` file with the correct database name.

5. Lastly, setup an env variable called `SECRET_KEY` whose value will be used in signing and decoding your jwt token.

Go ahead and start customizing as you desire.
